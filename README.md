# AfterTheSong - UE5 HorrorProject

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

After the Song is a short narrative-driven psychological horror game set in an underground facility following a mysterious outbreak. The project focuses on environmental storytelling, audio-based tension, and player isolation, with an emphasis on atmosphere over combat.

This repository contains an experimental prototype developed while learning Unreal Engine for the first time. The focus was on coding, gameplay systems, and understanding engine workflows, not on building a finished game.
